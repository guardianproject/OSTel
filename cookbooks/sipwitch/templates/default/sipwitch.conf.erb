     means that challenge digests will be relaxed for devices that are
     already registered with the server, and hence reduces the total sip
     traffic needed.  We map for 200 calls, set 2 dispatch threads for
     sip events, and bind to all interfaces.

<!-- special user id's.  The "system" id is used when the server creates a

     from the server itself.  For example, when feeding a sms "message"
     through the control interface, this is generated as a "system" message.
     Attempts to dial the "system" id will always return SIP FORBIDDEN.

     The "anon" id is used when anonymous messages are generated.  These
     always respond with SIP NOT FOUND if one wishes to contact anon.

<!-- Registry properties.  We specify support for numeric telephone
     extensions on this machine, for 100 extensions starting at
     extension 200.  This is useful when sharing a common set of
     user provisioning records over multiple servers which are routed
     and segmented.  Hence if I want to call an extension outside of
     the range of the server I register with, I initially authenticate
     since this server has the common provisioning, but I then am referred
     to the actual target server where the destination user is registered.

     Keysize is used for hash indexing range.  Realm is the realm presented
     for www authentication, but is normally set uuid or in /etc/siprealm.

<!-- Routing rules can do all sorts of transforms for dialed numbers.  The
     routing table can also be used to statically redirect ranges of
     extension numbers to alternate servers.  For example, we redirect 1xx
     numbers to a different server with something like:
     <redirect pattern="1xx" server="server.local"/>
     or a range of numbers to a single remote entity uri:
     <redirect pattern="3xx" target="sip:local@myserver.somewhere"/>

     Reject rules can be used to reject with specific error messages, and
     rewrite rules can add or subtract prefix or suffix codes.
